## Interactive Features

### Double-Click to Flip

Double-click any card to toggle between face up and face down states.

### Drag to Rotate

Click and drag horizontally to rotate the card. The rotation is calculated based on the horizontal distance dragged.

### Touch Support

Full support for touch events on mobile devices:

- Touch and drag to rotate
- Double-tap to flip (uses standard double-click event)

## Component API

### Properties

- `rotation: number` - Current rotation angle in degrees
- `isDragging: boolean` - Whether the card is currently being dragged
- `cardId: string` - Unique identifier for the card (e.g., "A-spades")
- `suitSymbol: string` - Unicode symbol for the suit (♥, ♦, ♣, ♠, 🃏)
- `suitColor: string` - Color of the suit ('red' or 'black')
- `displayRank: string` - The rank to display on the card
- `isJoker: boolean` - Whether this card is the joker

### Methods

- `toggleFace(): void` - Flips the card between face up and face down
- `resetRotation(): void` - Resets the card rotation to 0 degrees

## Styling

The component uses scoped CSS with the following features:

- **Card dimensions**: 100px × 140px (desktop), responsive on mobile
- **Border radius**: 8px for rounded corners
- **Shadow**: Drop shadow for depth
- **Cursor states**: Grab cursor when hoverable, grabbing when dragging
- **Transitions**: Smooth rotation transitions
- **Responsive**: Scales down appropriately on tablets and phones

### CSS Classes

- `.playing-card` - Main card container
- `.dragging` - Applied when card is being dragged
- `.face-down` - Applied when card is face down
- `.joker` - Applied to joker cards for special styling

## Testing

All 28 unit tests pass successfully:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --include='**/playing-card.component.spec.ts' --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadlessCI
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ Component creation and initialization
- ✅ All 53 card types (52 standard + 1 joker)
- ✅ Suit symbols for all suits
- ✅ Suit colors (red/black)
- ✅ Joker identification
- ✅ Face toggle functionality
- ✅ Rotation functionality
- ✅ Mouse drag interaction
- ✅ Touch drag interaction
- ✅ Draggable state handling
- ✅ Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Demo Component

A demo component is included at `/card-demo` route that showcases:

- Interactive single card with controls
- Grid of all 53 card types
- Controls to change suit, rank, face direction, and draggable state

To view the demo:

1. Start the dev server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:4200/card-demo`

## Implementation Details

### Card Layouts

Each rank has a specific layout pattern for the suit symbols:

- **Ace**: Single centered symbol
- **2-10**: Arranged in standard playing card patterns
- **Jack/Queen/King**: Large letter in center
- **Joker**: Special emoji symbol with "JOKER" text

### Rotation Algorithm

The rotation is calculated based on horizontal drag distance:

```typescript
this.rotation = this.startRotation + deltaX / 2;
```

This provides intuitive control where dragging right rotates clockwise and dragging left rotates counter-clockwise.

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Touch events for mobile devices
- Pointer events fallback

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions for future iterations:

- Animation effects for flipping
- Sound effects
- Different card back designs
- Stacking/layering support
- Deck shuffling utilities
- Card dealing animations

- All interactions are handled within the component itself
- The component follows Angular best practices and coding standards
- CSS follows the project's existing styling patterns
