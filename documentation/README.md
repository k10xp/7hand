# 7hand

is a rummy variation for all ages. featuring 7 hands to play each game!

## Getting Started with Development

ensure you have [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) in a shell environment. preferably vscode w/ devcontainers extension installed.

## Card Game Monorepo

This project contains both the frontend (Angular) and backend for a multiplayer card game.

### Project Structure

- `frontend/` – Angular app (served on port 4200 in dev, port 80 in prod)
- `backend/` – Express API (served on port 3000) [Legacy]
- `nginx-proxy/` – Nginx reverse proxy for production EC2 deployments (port 8000)
- `docker-compose.yml` – Orchestrates both services

### WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Networking

7hand uses WebRTC for real-time peer-to-peer game state synchronization between players. This reduces server load and latency by allowing players to communicate directly.

📖 **See [WEBRTC_NETWORKING.md](WEBRTC_NETWORKING.md) for detailed information about:**

- STUN and TURN server configuration
- Network infrastructure requirements
- Whether you need additional nodes for production
- Cost analysis and deployment recommendations

### Quick Start (with Docker Compose)

1. Build and start 3 main services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up frontend-dev backend db
   ```

2. Code in the container via `code frontend`. Select 'Reopen in Container' and Access the frontend at: <http://localhost:4200>
3. The backend API is available at: <http://localhost:3000>

### Development

- Code changes in `frontend/` or `backend/` will be reflected in the running containers (volumes are mounted).
- Stop the stack with `Ctrl+C` and remove containers with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

### Production Deployment

For production EC2 deployments, use the nginx reverse proxy:

1. Start the production stack with proxy:

   ```bash
   docker compose up sevenhand-proxy frontend backend db
   ```

2. Access the application through the proxy at: <http://localhost:8000>
3. Health check endpoint for load balancers: <http://localhost:8000/health>

The proxy provides:

- Unified entry point for frontend and backend
- Rate limiting and security features
- WebSocket support for real-time game features
- Optimized for AWS EC2 deployment

### Next Steps

- Implement game logic in the backend (`backend/index.js`)
- Build the game UI in the frontend (`frontend/src/app/`)
- Add user authentication, multiplayer support, and cloud deployment as needed.

## Go Backend Server

- **Clean, modular architecture** with comprehensive tests
- **Docker support** for containerized deployment
